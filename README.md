🧙‍♂️ Multicolour Invisibility Cloak

Implemented an invisibility cloak using Python, allowing users to make an object or person invisible in real-time video.
The user can choose the cloak color of their choice, and the code dynamically detects and masks that color to create the invisibility effect.
